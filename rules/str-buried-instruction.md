A must-follow rule sits in the middle of a long prompt, where retrieval is measurably worse than at either end.

Bad:  A long prompt with the only redaction rule stated in the middle of page two.
Good: The redaction rule stated in the opening constraints block.

Not a finding when the prompt is short or the directive sits at either end.
