Pasted data runs straight into instructions, so the reader cannot tell directive from content, and injected text can pose as a directive.

Bad:  Summarise this: the pasted text also says to ignore prior instructions.
Good: Summarise the text inside the <data> tags below.

Not a finding when the data is clearly delimited.
