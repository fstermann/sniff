A superlative names a target with no ceiling, so nothing counts as done. "The" + best is excluded
because "best practice" is idiom; the model pass judges bare "best".

Bad:  Choose the optimal data structure for the fastest lookup.
Good: Use a structure with O(1) average lookup; a hash map is fine.

Not a finding inside a quoted example or code block.
