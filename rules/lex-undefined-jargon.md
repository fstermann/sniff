An acronym or domain term used with no first-use expansion. A reader outside the domain is stuck.

Bad:  Set the MTU before the NIC initialises.
Good: Set the maximum transmission unit (MTU) before the network card initialises.

Not a finding when the term is expanded on first use or is universally known.
