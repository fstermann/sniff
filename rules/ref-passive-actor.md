Passive that omits who acts. Passive alone is fine; passive with no agent leaves the doer unspecified. The model confirms the actor is missing.

Bad:  The output should be validated.
Good: The CI job validates the output.

Not a finding when the actor is named ("validated by the gateway") or obvious in context.
