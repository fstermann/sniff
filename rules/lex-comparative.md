A comparative names a direction but no baseline, so nothing says how much or than what. The pattern is a trigger; the model checks whether a reference point is given.

Bad:  Make the parser faster.
Good: Make the parser run in under 100 ms.

Not a finding when a baseline follows ("faster than the current 200 ms") or inside a quoted example.
